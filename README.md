### Connect ESP32-S3 to Azure IoT

<b>About</b>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
This work details a step-by-step procedure for connecting the  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FREENOVE-ESP32-S3-WROOM-Compatible-Wireless-Detailed/dp/B0BMQ8F7FN/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=esp32-s3&qid=1702168220&sr=8-2-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1" alt="Amazon Product Page"> ESP32-S3 </a> to Azure IoT Central. The setup involves integrating the DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor to demonstrate remote data monitoring. Additionally, the remote 'Run' button on IoT Central is configured to control the built-in LED light on the ESP32-S3 microcontroller. To expand functionalities, a turbidity sensor was incorporated into the ESP32-S3.

     <b>Figure C2. DHT11 connection to ESP32-S3 (side view)</b>

2. Set up Arduino IDE
   
   - To communicate ESP32-S3 to an Arduino IDE, follow the instructions described in the manufacturer's manual (Freenove_Basic_Starter_Kit_for_ESP32_S3-main\C\C_Tutorial.pdf), which can be downloaded from <a href="https://freenove.com/tutorial">FNK0084 - Freenove Basic Starter Kit for ESP32-S3</a>
   
   - After configuring Arduino IDE environment according to the instructions described in the manual, set the board to ESP32S3 Dev Module. Access this option by going to Tools > Board: "ESP232S3 Dev Module" > ESP32S3 Dev Module. Also, select the appropriate communication port by going to Tools > Port: COMx. x is the port number (e.g., COM3). You only need do set the board and communication port once.  

3. Test DHT11 (Optional)
   
   - On Arduino IDE, go to File > New. Copy and paste the code below. The code will require the following dependencies to be installed. To install the dependencies on Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include library > Manage libraries...
     
     - DHT sensor library
     - Adafruit Unified Sensor
   
   - You only need to install these dependencies once.
   
   - If you wish to delete any of the installed libraries, navigate into *C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\Arduino\libraries* and manually delete the library folder. 
   
   - Go to Sketch > Verify/Compile. Read the error message to reveal any issues.

     #include "DHT.h"
     #define DHT11PIN 4
     
     DHT dht(DHT11PIN, DHT11);
     void setup()
     {
     
     Serial.begin(115200);
     /* Start the DHT11 Sensor */
     dht.begin();
     }
     
     void loop()
     {
     float humi = dht.readHumidity();
     float temp = dht.readTemperature();
     Serial.print("Temperature: ");
     Serial.print(temp);

     Serial.print("Humidity: ");
     Serial.println(humi);
     delay(1000);
     }
     ```
   
   - To view the humidity and temperature output from DHT11 sensor, go to Tools > Serial Monitor. The following window will pop out. Make sure to match the baud rate with the number you specify in the code. In this case, the baud rate is 115200.

4. Check wi-fi connection (Optional)
   
   - Upload the code below that is provided in the Freenove ESP32-S3 package, and check to make sure that you can be connected to the wi-fi network.
     
     ```
     #include <WiFi.h>
     
     const char* ssid = "yourNetworkName";
     const char* pass = "yourNetworkPassword";
     
     void setup() {
     Serial.begin(115200);
     Serial.println("Configure access piont");
     WiFi.softAP(ssid, pass);
     IPAddress myIP = WiFi.softAPIP();
     Serial.print("AP-IP Address");
     Serial.println(myIP);
     }
     
     void loop() {
     }
     ```

5. Connect Device to IoT Central via a Simulation Code
   5.1. Enable mobile hotspot to broadcast 2.4 GHz wifi network
   
   - Enable a mobile hotspot and set the Network band to 2.4 GHz (not 5 GHz). Note the Network name (SSID) and password amd turn the mobile hotspot on. 
     
     <img src="pics/FigC5.png">
     <b>Figure C5. Mobile hotspot configuration.</b>
   
   5.2. Upload script into ESP32-S3 microcontroller
   
   - Use the example code to connect the ESP32-S3 to Azure IoT central. You must first install the library by going to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries ... and search and install Azure SDK for C.
   
   - Once the library is installed, go to File > Examples > Azure SDK for C > Azure_IoT_Central_ESP32 to load the example script. 
   
   - Save the script as ESP32_AzureIoT_Simple/ESP32_AzureIoT_Simple.ino. The rest of the depent files will be saved along with it automatically.
   
   - Below shows the contents of the *iot_configs.h* file that requires modification. See section B to retrieve the relevant parameters.
     
     <img src="pics/FigC6a.png">
     <b> Figure C6a. The 2.4 GHz wifi that requires modification for SSID (network name) and password. </b>
     
     <img src="pics/FigC6b.png">
     <b> Figure C6b. The IoT Central parameters that require modifications for ID_SCOPE, DEVICE_ID, and DEVICE_KEY. </b>
   
   - Click on Sketch > Upload to load the script into the ESP32 microcontroller.
   
   - Once the upload is complete, go to Tools >  Serial Monitor.
     
     <img src="pics/FigC7.png">
     
     <b>Figure C7. Serial monitor showing the connection status.</b>
   
   - Below shows the status of the device on IoT Central.
     
     <img src="pics/FigC8.png">
     
     <b> Figure C8. Updated table.</b>
   
   - The table is now updated. The Device status automatically changes to Provisioned. A _default template_ is assigned automatically because the Azure Iot Central has a Plug and Play feature that simplifies the setup process by retrieving a device's telemetry, commands, and properties based on its ID. 
   
   - Click on esp32-dht11 to view the sensor parameters.The Overview tab is automatically selected to display the charts. If not, click on it.

     <b> Figure C9. esp32-dht11 Overview. </b>

6. Activate DHT11 and display temperature and humidity data on IoT Central [4]
   
   - In the iot_configs.h file, add the boxed script to acivate dht11.
   
   - In the ESP32_AzureIoT_Simple file, add the boxed script to activate dht11.
   
   - Follow the instructions in section 5 above to MODIFY the essential parameters in the iot_configs.h file (i.e., IOT_CONFIG_WIFI_SSID, IOT_CONFIG_WIFI_PASSWORD, DPS_ID_SCOPE, IOT_CONFIG_DEVICE_ID, and IOT_CONFIG_DEVICE_KEY) to suit your settings. I recommend copying and pasting these parameters rather than transcribing because the device may not function properly due to typo.
   
   - SET the DHT_PIN to 4 within the iot_config.h file (see Figure C10).
     
     <img src="pics/FigC10.png">
     
     <b> Figure C10. Change DHT_PIN to 4 in iot_configs.h. </b>
   
   - Upload the script into the ESP32-S3 microcontroller.
   
   - Once uploaded, it takes about a minute to be connected. You can also watch the status of the communication from the serial monitor window. Once connected, you will see that the temperature and humidity values change to a different value that the default values. You can blow hot air with a hair dryer or a heater fan to alter the temperature and humidity (See Figure C11).

#### F. <a name="f-add-a-turbidity-meter">Add a Turbidity Meter</a>

1. Installing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Turbidity-Quality-Monitoring-Detection-TSW-20M/dp/B07MVRQXFW/ref=asc_df_B07MVRQXFW/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=507909480377&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6932766439968375556&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9021681&hvtargid=pla-1346641968627&psc=1&mcid=27f231f67750332ebcb2015b543cb9c4&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4-TSr56GgwMVJjStBh1noAo8EAQYAyABEgLjxPD_BwE"> turbidity sensor </a> to ESP32-S3.

    - Figure F1 below shows how the turbidity meter is attached to the ESP32-S3 microcontroller, which are as follows.
    - G (Ground): GND (Black)
    - V (Voltage): 5 V (Red)
    - S (Signal): Pin No. 1 (Yellow)

    <img src="pics/FigF1.jpg">

    <b>Figure F1. Turbidity meter.</b>

2. The Arduino test script is as follows (adapted from Freenove's example codes, Sketch_08.1_ADC). This section is optional and is not needed to connect the turbidity sensor to the Iot Central.

    ```
    #define PIN_ANALOG_IN  1
    void setup() {
      Serial.begin(115200);
    }

    void loop() {
      int adcVal = analogRead(PIN_ANALOG_IN);
      double voltage = adcVal * (5.0 / 1024.0);
      Serial.printf("Sensor Output (V): %d, \t Voltage: %.2fV\r\n", adcVal, voltage);
      delay(200);
    }
    ```
3. Operation demonstration.
    - Once uploaded into the microcontroller, on Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Serial plotter to view the plot of signal versus time (Figure F2). As a test, I blocked the turbidity meter first with a piece of A4 white paper that caused the signal to dip close to zero. Second, I blocked the signal with a plastic ruler that caused the signal to dip only slightly.
